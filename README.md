# DC-GAR
Deep learning has become prominent in source code vulnerability detection due to its ability to automatically extract complex feature representations from code, eliminating the need for manually defined rules or patterns. Some methods treat code as text sequences, however, they often overlook its inherent structural information. In contrast, graph-based approaches effectively capture structural relationships but struggle with uneven feature vector extraction for vulnerability detection.

To address this issue, we propose an approach called Dual-channel Graph Neural Network combining Graph properties and Random walks (DC-GAR). This approach integrates graph properties and random walks within a dual-channel graph neural network framework to enhance vulnerability detection. Specifically, graph properties capture global semantic features, while random walks provide context-dependent node structure information. The combination of these features is then leveraged by the dual-channel graph neural network for detection and classification. We have implemented DC-GAR and evaluated it on a dataset of 29,514 functions. Experimental results demonstrate that DC-GAR surpasses state-of-the-art vulnerability detectors, including FlawFinder, VulDeePecker, SySeVR, Devign, and VulGAI, in terms of accuracy and F1-Score. Moreover, DC-GAR has proven effective and practical in real-world open-source projects.
